# Awesome Effective Altruism [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

**Effective Altruism is awesome in the original sense of the word "awesome"**â€”it's awe-inspiring and empowering to think how much one individual in developed countries can make a positive impact in the world effectively. :muscle:

Infused with the spirit of scientific rigor and the ethos of improving the world, Effective Altruism is making such endeavors even more potent.

Well-intentioned altruists have been shadowboxing against some of the knottiest problems due to a lack of scientific assessments of effectiveness. Usually, the world doesn't need more "-isms," but Effective Altruism may be the closest thing to a philanthropic revolution.

The passion in this nascent community is so palpable, and **I believe it behooves us developers to create projects, tools, data visualizations, etc., that could possibly help this world suffer a little less.** :earth_africa:
